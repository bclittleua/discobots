# discobots
- Making Discord Bots with Python can be confusing,
I've been through a lot of trial and error. I made
this file dump for the best working projects I
have been able to complete, boiled down to just
the essential functions unless an example was required.



- Hoping this helps you make your own discord bots,
it is fun and my tiny array of bots is very useful.
At least, useful to me.

- FYI: to get webhook URL, open your discord server settings>integrations>create webhook>copy webhook url
