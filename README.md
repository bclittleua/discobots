# discobots
Making Discord Bots with Python can be confusing,
I've been through a lot of trial and error. I made
this file dump for the best working projects I
have been able to complete, boiled down to just
the essential functions unless an example was required.



Hoping this helps you make your own discord bots,
it is fun and my tiny array of bots is very useful.
At least, useful to me.
