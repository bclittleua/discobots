# discobots
- Making Discord Bots with Python can be confusing,
I've been through a lot of trial and error. I made
this file dump for the best working projects I
have been able to complete, boiled down to just
the essential functions unless an example was required.



- Hoping this helps you make your own discord bots,
it is fun and my tiny array of bots is very useful.
At least, useful to me.














## getting started 
1. start with bare_bones
2. add bot to server with https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=00000000000000000000&permissions=8&scope=bot
   2a. Be sure to replace the 00000000000000 with your own client_id
3. easy to combine these principals once you get the hang of it
4. Feeling lost? Start here:
